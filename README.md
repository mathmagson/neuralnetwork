This project deserves all credits to Dr. John A. Bullinaria from the School of Computer Science of The University of Birmingham, UK.

You can find the base code in: [John Bullinaria 2004](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/INC/nn.c)

And the explanation here: [John Bullinaria NN C Code Explanation](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/INC/nn.html)

I'm trying to implement this code in a quadcopter based on PID controller.
